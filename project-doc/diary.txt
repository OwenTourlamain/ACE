Week 1:
    Mainly planning, choosing languages frameworks etc. and getting them set up.
    Final choices are:
        - Python 3.4    - Latest available for my systems, not much benefit for
                          upgrading for this project
        - PyQt5         - Python bindings for Qt5
        - Qt5           - Latest version available of the Qt5 GUI framework
        - json          - Used for configuration files
        - Git/Github    - Project is hosted in the (private) repo at:
                          github.com/OwenTourlamain/ACE-NG
